I have created a website about a game called Sashi: Past meets Present together with its description page, home page, beta form page(taking user inputs abou their experience with playing the open beta), about page(the people who made the said game) and product form(taking user inputs regarding the complete launch of the game and the player base experiences so far).

Home Page:  Serving as the main landing page, offering a summary of the game and navigating users to different sections of the website.

Description Page: A detailed explanation of the game itself, highlighting its theme, storyline, unique mechanics, and immersive experience that blends the past and present. This page also focuses on the visual style, gameplay modes, and target audience of the game.

Beta Form Page: This interactive section allows players of the open beta version to provide feedback on their experience, offering insights on gameplay, potential bugs, and suggestions for improvement.

About Page: A dedicated page introducing the development team behind Sashi: Past Meets Present, giving credit to the developers, designers, animators, and sound engineers. It enhances the studio's credibility while giving users a glimpse of the talents behind the game.

Product Form Page: This page collects feedback from users who have played the full release of the game. It asks for insights regarding user satisfaction, challenges encountered, overall experience, and suggestions for further updates or patches. It's an essential page for understanding the player base and their ongoing experiences.
